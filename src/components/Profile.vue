        p Hi there! My name is Nikita and I'm a serial product launcher. I'm half a developer, half an entrepreneur. If I can build something quick and efficient, I build it myself â€” if I cannot (whether I'm not at the right level of expertise or just don't have time) I delegate to my trusted list of contractors.
        p I started as an iOS developer but over the years I've mastered backend, frontend, Android, React Native development; as well as management, hiring, consulting, public speaking and a variety of other soft skills. My favorite stack at this time is Node + TypeScript + Koa + Mongo on backend, Vue + TypeScript + Vuetify on frontend, React Native on Mobile, Node + Telegraf.js for Telegram bots.
        p Please, find my contacts, the list of the products I'm most proud of with some of their stats as well as the list of publications below. Cheers!
